CompSherpa Negotiation Checklist
================================

Nurse Practitioner & Medical Professional Compensation Negotiation Checklist

Use this practical checklist to guide your job offer evaluation and contract negotiation. Each section is tailored for busy nurse practitioners and healthcare professionals seeking to maximize both compensation and long-term career satisfaction.

1. SALARY & CORE COMPENSATION
   â–¡ What is the base salary? Is it competitive for your specialty, experience, and region?
   â–¡ Are there opportunities for annual merit, cost-of-living, or market adjustments?
   â–¡ What is the salary review period (e.g., every 12 months)?
   â–¡ Are bonuses available (signing, performance, productivity)? What are the criteria?
   â–¡ How is overtime or additional shift pay (if applicable) structured?

2. BENEFITS & PERKS
   â–¡ Health insurance: What plans are offered (medical, dental, vision)? What portion does employer cover?
   â–¡ Retirement plan: Is there a 401(k), 403(b), or pension? What is the employer match percentage or contribution?
   â–¡ Paid time off (PTO): How many days for vacation, sick leave, personal, CME/conference, holidays?
   â–¡ Continuing education (CME/CE): Is there an annual allowance for CME fees, travel, and time off?
   â–¡ Student loan repayment or tuition reimbursement: Is there employer support? What are the terms and duration?
   â–¡ Malpractice/liability insurance: Is this fully covered, and does it include "tail" coverage?
   â–¡ Licensing, certification, professional dues: Are these fees reimbursed?
   â–¡ Relocation/signing bonus: Is there financial support for moving, and what are repayment clauses?

3. SCHEDULE & WORK ENVIRONMENT
   â–¡ What is the expected work schedule (hours, days/week, call/onsite requirements)?
   â–¡ Are there options for flexible scheduling, remote work, or telemedicine?
   â–¡ What administrative time is allotted (charting, care coordination)?
   â–¡ Is onboarding/training provided? What does orientation look like?
   â–¡ What is the expected patient volume per shift?

4. CAREER DEVELOPMENT & GROWTH
   â–¡ Are there opportunities for advancement (leadership, teaching, research, specialization)?
   â–¡ Is there a mentorship or support network for new hires?
   â–¡ Are performance reviews conducted regularly, and are clear goalposts set?

5. CONTRACT & LEGAL
   â–¡ Are all compensation and benefits detailed in writing in the offer and contract?
   â–¡ Does the contract include a non-compete or geographic restriction? Is it reasonable and negotiable?
   â–¡ What are the termination provisions (notice period, cause, severance)?
   â–¡ Is ownership of patient lists or intellectual property addressed?
   â–¡ Is there a clause specifying the process for contract renewal?

6. CRITICAL RED FLAGS
   â–¡ Vague language regarding compensation, duties, or benefits.
   â–¡ Unreasonable non-compete or restrictive covenants.
   â–¡ No clear process for performance improvement, review, or salary increases.
   â–¡ Absence of standard malpractice insurance or "tail" coverage.
   â–¡ Productivity expectations not aligned with industry standards.

TIP: Bring this checklist to interviews and offer discussions. Mark all areas provided, negotiable, or needing clarification.
